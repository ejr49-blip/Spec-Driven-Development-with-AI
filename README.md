## Reflection

This portfolio project taught me how to go from a vague idea into a structured, finished product. Instead of trying to immediately build the final version of the product, I followed a development process. I started by exploring design directions and thinking about a certain audience and credibility. That helped me decide on a clear visual and structure before writing code.

Next, I made sure to define the content model and information. I learned that portfolios are not only about visuals. They needed proof and each project had to demonstrate something specific and include evidence of skills. Writing this made me to think clearly about what “done” actually meant.

Breaking the project into smaller parts helped prevent overthinking. Each part had a goal, tasks, and a criteria to follow on. This made the process manageable and kept the project from going off track. 

Overall, I learned that building a site is less about coding and more about planning and double-checking. The structured work and planning made the process feel controlled instead of all over the place.
